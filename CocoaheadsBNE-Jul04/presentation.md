## Codable

> Turns out if you go deep enough, itâ€™s Objective-C all the way down.

1. Array, encode yourself to `_JSONEncoder`
2. Array sets up unkeyed container (NSMutableArray storage)
3. Array iterates over all elements and encodes them
  - Integer, encode yourself to `_JSONEncoder`
  - Integer sets up single-value container
  - Integer asks the container to encode itself
    - Container boxes the integer into `NSNumber`, adds to the array
4. Use JSONSerialization to encode the top-level `NSMutableArray`

Useful because swift closures make reference cycles incredibly easy to have slip in
After all, a swift closure can implicitly strongly capture self
