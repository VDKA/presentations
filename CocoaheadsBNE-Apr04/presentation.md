# Warnings on 'Hot Code Push SDKs'

rollout.io users have begun seeing Review rejections based on:

^ "any code which passes arbitrary parameters to dynamic methods such as `dlopen()`, `dlsym()`, `respondsToSelector:`, `performSelector:`, `method_exchangeImplementations()`"

> "combined with a remote resource, can facilitate significant changes to your appâ€™s behavior from that reviewed"

> "Even if the remote resource is not intentionally malicious, could easily be hijacked via a MiTM attack"

# Asserting equality

^ It can be easy to let `==` fall out of sync with your `struct` if you add fields
^ This will alert you if you forget

Check for outdated equality operators automatically (at runtime)

```
static func ==(lhs: Person, rhs: Person) -> Bool {
    let areEqual = lhs.name == rhs.name
    if areEqual {
        assertDumpsEqual(lhs, rhs)
    }
    return areEqual
}
```
